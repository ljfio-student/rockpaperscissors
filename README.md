# Multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors

A multiplayer version of the well known rock, paper, scissors. Created as a project to demonstrate my NodeJS 'skill-set' in 2013.

The project uses the following technologies:
- NodeJS (http, url, fs)
- Socket.IO (previously Engine.IO)
- Async
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

# How to play

Navigate to the website to play the game and start your game by clicking the "Click me to play" button.
You will then be placed into a queue to join a game with the next available opponent.

Choose your weapon wisely, as if you fail to choose the superior weapon you will be destroyed by your opponent.

If you wish to try your chances at defeating your opponent, play again by clicking the "Play Again?" again button.
